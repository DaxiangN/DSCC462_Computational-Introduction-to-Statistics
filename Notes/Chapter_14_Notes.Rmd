1. Denote the true population correlation of X and Y as rho
2. Correlation example
3. Correlation: inference
	a. Use sample correlation r to do hypothesis testing
	b. t = 
	c. X and Y are normally distributed
	d. There are non-parametric methods, but won't be covered in class.
4. In R: cor.test()
5. Limitations:
	a. Only describes linear relationships
	b. Could be missing nonlinear relationship
6. Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient - more robust than pearson
	a. Needs normal distribution assumption - maybe not, Dr. Kahng will check it.
	b. Not sensitive to outliers.
	c. Assumption is a little bit weaker (?), but may need those two populations to have same shape (histogram).
In R: cor.test(exact = FALSE) when n >= 10, when n < 10, exact = T.
