# Plan for Today
1. Learn to evaluate how good our linear regreession is


# Evaluating Model Fit

# Coefficient of Deetermination
1. Extremes:
   1. $R^2 = 1$, perfect
   2. $R^2 = 0$, not linear at all

# Residual plot
1. residuals = actual - predicted
2. a residual plot is a scatterplot of the residuals over the fitted values $\hat y$
3. if there is no trend in residual plot
   1. relationship is non-linear
