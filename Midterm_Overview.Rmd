# Chapter 1: Statistical Data

-   definition of variable types
    -   categorical: nominal and ordinal
    -   Quantitative: Interval and Ratio

# Chapter 2: Descriptive Statistics and Displays

-   Categorical:

    -   Frequency Tables, bar charts

-   Continuous:

    -   Histograms, Sturges' formula

    -   Boxplots, modified boxplots

    -   Center: mean, trimeed mean, median, mode

    -   Dispersion: quantiles, IQR, variance, standard deviation, coefficient of variantion, skewness

    -   concentration: z-scores, empritical rule

    -   Normality, quantile plots, linear transformations, Box-Cox transformation

# Chapter 3: Relationships Between Variables

-   CQ: side-by-side histograms or boxplots
-   CC: two-way tables
-   QQ: Scatterplot
    -   Strength, direction, form, outliers

    -   correlation(direction and correlation) and covariance(only tells directions, not frequently used when talking about correlation, but good concept for later study

# Chapter 4: Probability and Combinatorics

-   Probability:

    -   intersection, union, complement of events

-   Combinatorics:

    -   Permutations (ordered)

    -   product and sum rules

    -   star and bars

# Chapter 5: Distributions

-   Discrete and continuous random variables:

    -   PMFs. PDFs, CDFs, quantiles

    -   Expacted value, linearity of expectation, variance, transformations

    -   independence, covariance

-   Distributions

    -   for cheat sheet, the mean and variance for all of the distributions discussed

    -   Discrete:...

    -   Continuous:...

    -   Sampling distributions, CLT

    -   **Sampling Distribution of a Proportion** vs **Binomial**

    -   ??? if X \~ Binom(n, p), sample for 50 times, X_bar \~ N(np, sqrt(p\*(1-p)/n)

# Chapter 6: Confidence Intervals

# Chapter 7: Hypothesis Tests

-   One- and two-sided z- and t-tests CIs are the same here;

-   rejection regions Type I and type II errors, power

-   Sample size given α and β (one-sided and two-sided z- and t-tests)

-   **Power curve**

-   **Sample size estimation**

# Chapter 8: Hypothesis Testing with Two Samples

# Chapter 9: Inference for Variances

# Chapter 10: Inference for Proportions

# Chapter 11: Chi-squared Tests

# Chapter 12: Nonparametric Tests
