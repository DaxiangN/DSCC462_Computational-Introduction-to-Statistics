# Type I and Type II Error, calculating power:

# Skewness

Left (negative) skew: The left tail extends farther out than the right tail Right (positive skew): The right tail extends farther out than the left tail

# Quantiles

## Percentiles and quartiles

The p sample quantile is the value below which a proportion p of the data are located.

E.g., if your birth weight is at the 95th percentile, then you weighed more than 0.95 of all newborn babies.

IQR: Interquartile Range = Q3 - Q1

1st quartile (Q1): 25th percentile, 2nd quartile (Q2): 50th percentile (median), 3rd quartile (Q3): 75th percentile.

## Modified Boxplot

An outlier is a data point that is either:

-   Less than: Q1 − 1.5 × (Q3 − Q1) = lower fence of box
-   Greater than: Q3 + 1.5 × (Q3 − Q1) = upper fence of boxplot
-   Standard span: 1.5 × (Q3 − Q1) = 1.5 × IQR
